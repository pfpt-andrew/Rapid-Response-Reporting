Malware researchers can reverse engineer malware variants that use DGAs and determine future domains that the malware will attempt to contact, but this is a time and resource intensive effort. Malware is also increasingly incorporating seed values that can be unique for each instance, which would then need to be determined to extract future generated domains. In some cases, the seed that a particular sample uses can be extracted from DNS traffic. Even so, there can be thousands of possible domains generated per day; this makes it impractical for defenders to preemptively register all possible C2 domains due to the cost.","T1483","[CCBkdr](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0222) can use a DGA for [Fallback Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008) if communications with the primary command and control server are lost.","command-and-control"
