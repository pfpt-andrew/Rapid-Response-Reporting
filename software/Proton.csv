"Network Intrusion Prevention","binary file metadata","data compressed","Proton","[Proton](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0279) is a macOS backdoor focusing on data theft and credential access  (Citation: objsee mac malware 2017).","Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries.","Network intrusion prevention or data loss prevention tools may be set to block specific file types from leaving the network over unencrypted channels. An adversary may move to an encrypted channel or use other mechanisms of encapsulating the traffic in these situations.","T1002","[Proton](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0279) zips up files before exfiltrating them.","exfiltration"
"Remote Data Storage","windows event logs","indicator removal on host","Proton","[Proton](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0279) is a macOS backdoor focusing on data theft and credential access  (Citation: objsee mac malware 2017).","Use remote security log and sensitive file storage where access can be controlled better to prevent exposure of intrusion detection log data or sensitive information.","Automatically forward events to a log server or data repository to prevent conditions in which the adversary can locate and manipulate data on the local system. When possible, minimize time delay on event reporting to avoid prolonged storage on the local system.","T1070","[Proton](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0279) removes logs from /var/logs and /Library/logs.","defense-evasion"
