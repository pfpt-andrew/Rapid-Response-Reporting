Use of encryption protocols may make typical network-based C2 detection more difficult due to a reduced ability to signature the traffic. Prior knowledge of adversary C2 infrastructure may be useful for domain and IP address blocking, but will likely not be an effective long-term solution because adversaries can change infrastructure often.","T1079","[Sykipot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0018) communicates using HTTPS and uses a custom encryption cipher to encrypt the HTTPS message body.","command-and-control"
