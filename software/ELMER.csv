Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific protocol used by a particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions. Adversaries will likely change tool C2 signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way as to avoid detection by common defensive tools.","T1043","[ELMER](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0064) uses HTTP over port 443 for command and control.","command-and-control"
