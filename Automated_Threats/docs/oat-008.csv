Identity Code,Class,Remediation
OAT-008,Value,"Consider providing guidance and encouragement to users about how to select stronger and unique passwords, and the importance of protecting relevant password recovery mechanisms (e.g. email account, mobile phones)."
OAT-008,Requirements,Document acceptable use of authentication functions; define additional requirements.
OAT-008,Testing,Define test cases for OAT-008 Credential Stuffing that confirm the application will detect and/or prevent users attempting to use account credentials in bulk.
OAT-008,Capacity,Not applicable
OAT-008,Obfuscation,"Consider randomising the content and URLs of authentication form pages, tying these changes to the individual user’s session, verifying the changes at each authentication step, and restricting any identified automated usage."
OAT-008,Fingerprinting,Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by fingerprinting the User Agent for its unique characteristics.
OAT-008,Reputation,"Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by reputation methods. In particular, consider using public breach data to identify at-risk user accounts and force a password change, or increase anti-fraud measures on these accounts. Consider using geolocation and/or IP address block lists to prevent access to authentication functions. Consider using email address reputation services, if used for username."
OAT-008,Authentication,"Consider not permitting social media login. Consider methods to attempt to ensure users have unique passwords such as expiring passwords periodically and preventing password re-use. Consider enhancing authentication by adding CAPTCHA, or adding application-specific challenge questions, or using strong authentication such as two factor authentication. Consider preventing users from utilising email addresses as usernames, or using application-specific usernames which are less likely to exist on other systems. Consider stricter measures for user accounts with greater permissions (e.g. staff, moderators, content administrators, system accounts). Consider pre-registering users and implementing strong authentication for access to any exposed authentication APIs."
OAT-008,Rate,Limit the number of authentication attempts (success or failure) per session/user/IP address/device/ fingerprint.
OAT-008,Monitoring,"Log successful and unsuccessful authentication attempts across all functions (register, logon, password reset, password change, username change, re-authentication, etc) and channels (web, mobile app, call centre, etc); monitor rates relative to normal activity and also relative the usage of the rest of the application. Identify account hijacking reports from customers; monitor absolute numbers and trends."
OAT-008,Instrumentation,"Consider blocking or delaying access by users in a particular session, IP address/range or geolocation or everyone once Monitoring has identified a real Credential Stuffing attack, or other anomalous behaviour that has identified the user as an attacker."
OAT-008,Contract,Define service limits for any authentication APIs.
OAT-008,Response,Define actions to be taken in the event a Credential Stuffing attack is detected.
OAT-008,Sharing,Participate in threat intelligence exchanges and contribute Credential Stuffing attack data to sector-wide sharing systems.
