OAT-016,Value,Not applicable
OAT-016,Requirements,Identify all metrics and ways they could be manipulated by different types of users; define additional requirements. Define logging requirements that capture sufficient information for thorough analysis of application activity contributing to each metric
OAT-016,Testing,Define test cases for OAT-016 Skewing that confirm the application will detect and/or prevent users attempting to skew metrics.
OAT-016,Capacity,Not applicable
OAT-016,Obfuscation,"Consider randomising the content and URLs of metric-related content, tying these changes to the individual user’s session, verifying the changes at each request, and restricting any identified automated usage."
OAT-016,Fingerprinting,Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by fingerprinting the User Agent for its unique characteristics. Use the information to reject related metric contributions.
OAT-016,Reputation,"Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by reputation methods. In particular, consider using geolocation and/or IP address block lists and/or reputation services to exclude fraudulent data contributing to the metrics."
OAT-016,Authentication,"Consider requiring identity authentication, re-authentication or some other increased authentication assurance for access to areas where metric data are collected."
OAT-016,Rate,"Consider adding delays to metric-contributing actions. Consider limiting the number of times and/or rate at which the activity of a session, and/or IP address, and/or account/user and/or device/fingerprint contributes to each metric. Consider enforcing single-use and a limited period of validity for metriccontributing one-time tokens/codes."
OAT-016,Monitoring,"Log all activity contributing to metrics; monitor trends and abnormal patterns. Perform analysis, near real-time if possible, for common patterns in users’ system fingerprints, IP addresses and HTTP headers (such as User Agent, cookies, etc.), especially for requests during extremes of metric values."
OAT-016,Instrumentation,Not applicable
OAT-016,Contract,"Define end user T&Cs, employee contracts, corporate policies etc to ensure users understand that metric Skewing is not permissible."
OAT-016,Response,Define actions to be taken in the event a Skewing attack is detected.
OAT-016,Sharing,Not applicable
