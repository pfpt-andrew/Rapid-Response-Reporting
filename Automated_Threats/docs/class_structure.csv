Value,"Removing or limiting the value of assets accessed using the application can reduce the benefits of an automated attack. This includes reviewing whether the data and/or functionality is necessary, or whether it can be changed to reduce its value to an attacker.",y,n,y,n,n
Requirements,"Identify relevant automated threats in security risk assessment, and assess effects of alternative countermeasures on functionality usability and accessibility. Use this to then define additional application development and deployment requirements",y,y,y,y,y
Testing,Create abuse and misuse test cases that simulate automated web attacks.,y,n,y,n,n
Capacity,Build adequate capacity so that any permitted and possible unwanted automated usage do not affect normal usage/ performance.,y,y,y,n,y
Obfuscation,"Hinder automated attacks by dynamically changing URLs, field names and content, or limiting access to indexing data, or adding extra headers/fields dynamically, or converting data into images, or adding page and session-specific tokens. This countermeasure also includes minimising information leakage, randomisation of functionality such that the application cannot be fully determined in advance, cloaking and other changes to confuse or misinform automated systems from understanding or fully mapping the application and its functions.",y,y,y,n,n
Fingerprinting,"Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by automation identification techniques. Utilise user agent string, and/or HTTP request format (e.g. header ordering), and/or HTTP header anomalies (e.g. HTTP protocol, header inconsistencies), and/or device fingerprint content to determine whether a user is likely to be a human or not.",y,y,y,y,n
Reputation,"Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by reputation methods. Utilise reputation analysis of user identity (e.g. web browser fingerprint, device fingerprint, username, session, IP address/range/geolocation), and/or user behaviour (e.g. previous site, entry point, time of day, rate of requests, rate of new session generation, paths through application), and/or types of resources accessed (e.g. static vs dynamic, invisible/hidden links, robots.txt file, paths excluded in robots. txt, honeytrap resources, cache-defined resources), and/or types of resources not accessed (e.g. JavaScript generated links), and/or types of resources repeatedly accessed. Like Fingerprinting, used to determine whether a user is likely to be a human or not. Includes use of fraud detection systems and third-party deny/block lists, reputation, and credit-checking services.",y,y,y,y,n
Authentication,"Implement access control lists, or require users to be authenticated, or to re-authenticate, or behavioural biometrics, or to require greater identity verification to perform some functions including email address validation, use of puzzles/CAPTCHAs, out-of-band verification, password complexity and aging requirements, strong authentication, two-factor authentication, additional identity check at delivery/collection time, preventing concurrent usage with same identity, avoiding single-factor password based authentication, preventing the use of single sign on (SSO), and not supporting virtual currencies.",y,y,y,n,n
Rate,"Set upper and/or lower limits and/or trend thresholds, and limit number and/or rate of usage per user, per group of users, per IP address/range, per device ID/fingerprint etc. Also limitation of value per event/transaction. Also includes use of queuing systems, user-prioritization functionality, and randomisation of asset allocation.",y,y,y,y,n
Monitoring,"Monitor errors, anomalies, function usage/sequencing, and provide alerting and/or monitoring dashboard. Monitor (e.g moderate) user-generated content by automated systems.",y,y,n,y,n
Instrumentation,"Build in application-wide instrumentation to perform real-time attack detection and automated response such as defined in OWASP AppSensor. Responses to an identified automated attack could be instigated by the application directly, and/ or using some other system component such as a gateway, network firewall or application firewall. Responses can include increased monitoring, locking users out, blocking, delaying, changing behaviour, altering capacity/capability, enhanced identity authentication, CAPTCHA, penalty box, etc",y,y,y,y,y
Contract,"Require users not to undertake automated attacks against the application through terms & conditions, contracts, and guidance. Understand contractual restrictions imposed by other parties on the application (e.g. service level agreements, financial credit).",n,y,y,n,n
Response,"Define actions in an incident response plan for various automated attack scenarios. Consider automated responses once an attack is detected. Consider using actual incident data to feed back into other countermeasures (e.g. Requirements, Testing, Monitoring).",n,y,n,n,y
Sharing,"Share information about automated attacks, such as IP addresses or known violator device fingerprints, with others in same sector, with trade organisations, and with national CERTs.",n,y,n,y,n
