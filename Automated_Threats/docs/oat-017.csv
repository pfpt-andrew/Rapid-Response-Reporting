Identity Code,Class,Remediation
OAT-017,Value,"Consider ensuring there are frequent data backups so that original information and state can be restored in the event of contamination by a spamming attack. Consider limiting the functionality and/ or capacity available to newly, or recently, created accounts. Consider preventing users from adding/ sending URLs, and/or images, and/or other files."
OAT-017,Requirements,Identify all aspects of the application that could be used to generate spam; define additional requirements. Define logging requirements that capture sufficient information to assess whether spamming is occurring.
OAT-017,Testing,Define test cases for OAT-017 Spamming that confirm the application will detect and/or prevent users attempting to generate spam.
OAT-017,Capacity,Not applicable
OAT-017,Obfuscation,"Consider randomising the content and URLs of content, tying these changes to the individual user’s session, verifying the changes at each request, and restricting any identified automated usage."
OAT-017,Fingerprinting,Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by fingerprinting the User Agent for its unique characteristics.
OAT-017,Reputation,"Consider denying or restricting access from IP addresses known to be vulnerability scanners, web crawlers or cloud providers.”"
OAT-017,Authentication,"Consider requiring identity authentication, re-authentication or some other increased authentication assurance for access to areas where user-generated content, alerts or messages are created."
OAT-017,Rate,"Consider adding delays to actions the create user-generated content, alerts or messages."
OAT-017,Monitoring,"Consider the use of moderation for user-generated content. Log all activity related to functions that could be used to generate spam; monitor trends and abnormal patterns. Perform analysis, near realtime if possible, for common patterns in users’ system fingerprints, IP addresses and HTTP headers (such as User Agent, cookies, etc.). Identify spam reports from customers; monitor trends."
OAT-017,Instrumentation,"Consider blocking or delaying access or delaying access by users in a particular session, IP address/ range or geolocation once Monitoring has identified a real Spamming attack, or other anomalous behaviour that has identified the user as an attacker."
OAT-017,Contract,"Define end user T&Cs, employee contracts, corporate policies etc to ensure users understand that any form of Spamming is not permissible."
OAT-017,Response,Define actions to be taken in the event a Spamming attack is detected.
OAT-017,Sharing,Participate in threat intelligence exchanges and contribute Spamming attack data to sector-wide sharing systems.
