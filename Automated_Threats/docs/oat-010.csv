Identity Code,Class,Remediation
OAT-010,Value,Consider fully outsourcing all payment aspects to an appropriate payment services provider (PSP) that has its own countermeasures in place for OAT-010. Increase the minimum checkout value. Consider removing payment by card completely if alternatives are available and suitable.
OAT-010,Requirements,Document acceptable use of checkout/payment functions; define additional requirements.
OAT-010,Testing,"Define test cases for OAT-010 Card Cracking that confirm the application will detect and/or prevent users trying to guess start/expiry dates or security codes for a single payment card primary account number (PAN), and users trying multiple card PANs with a single expiry date and/or security code."
OAT-010,Capacity,Not applicable
OAT-010,Obfuscation,"Consider randomising the content and URLs of payment form and payment submission pages, tying these changes to the individual user’s session, verifying the changes at each payment step, and restricting any identified automated usage."
OAT-010,Fingerprinting,Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by fingerprinting the User Agent for its unique characteristics.
OAT-010,Reputation,"Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by reputation methods. In particular, consider using geolocation and/or IP address block lists to prevent access to payment parts of the application. Consider using address and card reputation services. Consider adding delays in the checkout steps for new and/or infrequent customers, and for smaller checkout baskets, and for users that appear to have skipped directly to payment bypassing basket addition and checkout, or are using known fraudulent payment cards."
OAT-010,Authentication,"Consider removing guest checkout and/or requiring greater identity authentication for customers. Consider adding CAPTCHA step for new and/or infrequent customers, and for smaller checkout baskets, and for users that appear to have skipped directly to payment. Consider implementing 3D Secure for some or all card payments. Consider pre-registering users and implementing strong authentication for access to any exposed payment APIs."
OAT-010,Rate,Consider limiting the number of failed card authorisation attempts per session/user/IP address/device/ fingerprint.
OAT-010,Monitoring,Log abandoned baskets; monitor rates. Log basket payment amount (and currency); monitor average value trends. Log successful and failed card authorisations; monitor rates relative to normal activity and also relative the usage of the rest of the application. Track chargeback amounts and trends.
OAT-010,Instrumentation,"Consider blocking or delaying payment function access by users in a particular session, IP address/range or geolocation or everyone once Monitoring has identified a real Card Cracking attack, or other anomalous behaviour that has identified the user as an attacker."
OAT-010,Contract,"Define T&Cs to explicitly ban users from using the payment parts of the application to undertake Card Cracking, and consider requiring opt-in agreement to these before the application can be used (or as part of the checkout process). Define service limits for any payment APIs."
OAT-010,Response,Define actions to be taken in the event a Card Cracking attack is detected.
OAT-010,Sharing,Use card issuers’ services that can identify distributed guessing attacks. Participate in e-commerce threat intelligence exchanges and contribute attack data to sector-wide sharing systems. Participate in any fraud detection and prevention arrangements offered by the payment service provider or merchant bank.
