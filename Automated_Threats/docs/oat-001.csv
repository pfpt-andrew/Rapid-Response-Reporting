Identity Code,Class,Remediation
OAT-001,Value,Consider fully outsourcing all payment aspects to an appropriate payment services provider (PSP) that has its own countermeasures in place for OAT-001. Consider increasing the minimum checkout value. Consider removing payment by card completely if alternatives are available and suitable.
OAT-001,Requirements,Document acceptable use of payment functions; define additional requirements.
OAT-001,Testing,Define test cases for OAT-001 Carding that confirm the application will detect and/or prevent users attempting to use cardholder data in bulk.
OAT-001,Capacity,Not applicable
OAT-001,Obfuscation,"Consider randomising the content and URLs of payment form and payment submission pages, tying these changes to the individual user’s session, verifying the changes at each payment step, and restricting any identified automated usage."
OAT-001,Fingerprinting,Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by fingerprinting the User Agent for its unique characteristics.
OAT-001,Reputation,"Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by reputation methods. In particular, consider using geolocation and/or IP address block lists to prevent access to payment parts of the application. Consider using address and card reputation services. Consider adding delays in the checkout steps for new and/or infrequent customers, and for smaller checkout baskets, and for users that appear to have skipped directly to payment bypassing basket addition and checkout, or are using known fraudulent payment cards."
OAT-001,Authentication,"Consider removing guest checkout and/or requiring greater identity authentication for customers. Consider adding a CAPTCHA step for new and/or infrequent customers, and for smaller checkout baskets, and for users that appear to have skipped directly to payment. Consider implementing 3D Secure for some or all card payments. Consider pre-registering users and implementing strong authentication for access to any exposed payment APIs."
OAT-001,Rate,Limit the number of card authorisation attempts per session/user/IP address/device/fingerprint.
OAT-001,Monitoring,Log abandoned baskets; monitor rates. Log basket payment amount (and currency); monitor average value trends. Log successful and failed card authorisations; monitor rates relative to normal activity and also relative the usage of the rest of the application. Track chargeback amounts and trends.
OAT-001,Instrumentation,"Consider blocking or delaying payment function access by users in a particular session, IP address/range or geolocation or everyone once Monitoring has identified a real Carding attack, or other anomalous behaviour that has identified the user as an attacker."
OAT-001,Contract,"Use application access/use terms and conditions (T&Cs) to explicitly ban users from using the payment parts of the application to undertake Carding, and consider requiring opt-in agreement to these before the application can be used (or as part of the checkout process). Define service limits for any payment APIs."
OAT-001,Response,Define actions to be taken in the event a Carding attack is detected.
OAT-001,Sharing,Participate in e-commerce threat intelligence exchanges and contribute attack data to sector-wide sharing systems. Participate in any fraud detection and prevention arrangements offered by the payment service provider or merchant bank.
