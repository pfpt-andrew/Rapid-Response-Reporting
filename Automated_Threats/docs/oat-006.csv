OAT-006,Value,Consider adding penalties for hastened progress
OAT-006,Requirements,Document acceptable use of each process exposed by the application; define additional requirements.
OAT-006,Testing,Define test cases for OAT-006 Expediting that confirm the application will detect and/or prevent users attempting to violate explicit or implicit assumptions about normal use.
OAT-006,Capacity,Not applicable
OAT-006,Obfuscation,"Randomise the content and URLs, tying these changes to the individual user’s session, verifying the changes at each request, and restricting any identified automated usage."

OAT-006,Monitoring,Log process step completion timestamps and rate of data entry; monitor for faster-than-average progress.
OAT-006,Instrumentation,"Consider blocking or delaying access or delaying access by users in a particular session, IP address/ range or geolocation once Monitoring has identified a real Expediting attack, or other anomalous behaviour that has identified the user as an attacker."
OAT-006,Contract,Define T&Cs to explicitly define acceptable use.
OAT-006,Response,Define actions to be taken in the event an Expediting attack is detected.
