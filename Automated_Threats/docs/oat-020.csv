Identity Code,Class,Remediation
OAT-020,Value,Consider providing dedicated APIs for any approved aggregators. Consider providing benefits to users that are using the application directly (and not via an account aggregator). Consider providing separate functionality for users’ approved and authenticated advisors etc so they can view either individual client or aggregated client access.
OAT-020,Requirements,Identify where Account Aggregation would be a threat to the application; define additional requirements.
OAT-020,Testing,Define test cases for OAT-020 Account Aggregation that confirm the application will detect and/or prevent users utilising some form of aggregation.
OAT-020,Capacity,Not applicable
OAT-020,Obfuscation,"Consider randomising the content and URLs of key content, tying these changes to the individual user’s session, verifying the changes at each request, and restricting any identified automated usage."
OAT-020,Fingerprinting,Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by fingerprinting the User Agent for its unique characteristics.
OAT-020,Reputation,"Consider identifying and restricting automated usage by reputation methods. In particular, consider identifying and blocking IP addresses of known aggregation services."
OAT-020,Authentication,"Consider creating and enforcing password aging controls. Consider enhancing authentication by adding CAPTCHA, or adding application-specific challenge questions, or using strong authentication such as two factor authentication. Consider pre-registering users and implementing strong authentication for access to any exposed APIs. Consider implementing strong authentication application-wide."
OAT-020,Rate,Limit the rate of requests per session/user/IP address/device/fingerprint.
OAT-020,Monitoring,"Log application-wide activity; monitor for unusual peaks. Log click-through and conversion rates for links within the application; monitor individual user rates relative to average rates. Log access behaviour patterns (e.g. source geolocation, days/times, paths taken by user through the application); monitor repeated patterns for individuals and groups of users."
OAT-020,Instrumentation,"Consider blocking or delaying access by users in a particular session, IP address/range or geolocation once Monitoring has identified a real Account Aggregation attack, or other anomalous behaviour that has identified the user as an attacker."
OAT-020,Contract,"Define T&Cs to explicitly ban users from using aggregation tools, and consider requiring opt-in agreement to these before the application can be used. Define acceptable use and service limits for any APIs used by approved aggregators."
OAT-020,Response,Define actions to be taken in the event an Account Aggregation attack is detected.
OAT-020,Sharing,Participate in threat intelligence exchanges and contribute Account Aggregation attack data to sectorwide sharing systems.
